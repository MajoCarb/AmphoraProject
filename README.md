# AmphoraProject

I created an environment using Anaconda in which I imported all the necessary tools.

My code was built with Python 3.7.13

To run the program, make sure to have imported:

import pandas as pd 

import numpy as np 

from sklearn import preprocessing

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

from sklearn import metrics

from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

from sklearn import svm

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
